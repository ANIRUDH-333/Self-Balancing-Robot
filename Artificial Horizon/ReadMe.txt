Arduino
1. Open the code in Arduino
2. Add the libraries mentioned
3. Uncomment specificc parts mentioned in the code for result with Kalman and without Kalman filter.
4. You can see the results in both processing and Serial monitor.
5. Ensure baudrate before you proceed.

Processing
1. Open the code in processing
2. Add the libraries mentioned
3. Change the port according to your serial port in Arduino
4. This you can identify by going to Tools -> Port in Arduino
5. Change that pert in line 37 in Processing.
6. Now run the code and play with it!!
