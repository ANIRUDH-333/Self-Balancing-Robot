# Self-Balancing-Robot

We wonder how a hoverboard balances itself because it uses the principle of a self-balancing robot that is two-wheeled and balances itself.
What happens if the pilot doesnâ€™t know the information in terms of the aircraft's attitude both in pitch and roll.
To resolve this problem artificial horizon is used.
It is referred to as gyros or artificial horizons, operated with a gyroscope that indicates at which level aircraft are oriented to the earth.
